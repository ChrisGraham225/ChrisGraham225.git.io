My chosen character is the viewer although this story is short with just 7 pages it’s still an interesting concept. After going through many ideas trials and errors, I just remembered a time where I was lost at the subway station. It was a horrifying experience for me years ago. The most challenging part of the project was coming up with an idea that I could work with also learning how to code isn’t easy I had a hard time understanding coding which held me back in finishing my project.
