Tittle: A lost Cause
Semester:2019

This project is about making up your own story based on the things we’ve learned since september. You are required to integrate pass projects to make your story, you are not limited from using any methods in making your story. In addition you could use a p5 code to animate your story to come to life. As for me, I used a p5 code to convey an orb like necklace that I created the gem follows the mouse but once clicked it could play music. The whole process was very hard but rewarding coming from a person who has no former background in coding. The story could be as long as you wanted. An example of what could consist in your website is two images, one animation and one image. It's all up to you to decide on what to do.

My project is a tragic hero’s tale who lost everything but has the capability to fight back. My story is short but it’s an interesting read. In my project it consists of 2 gifs, 1 p5 file, 8-9 pictures, and 2 links. It took me a couple of days to get things together but overall it was a fun project. My project is based on the movie to John Wick but altered a little bit.
